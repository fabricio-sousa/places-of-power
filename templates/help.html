        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p class="lead">Hi, my name is Fabricio, and I'd like to thank you for exploring. Since I was a child, I've had an interest in spirituality. In exploring the world, I noticed some places were very special, providing me with inspiration to be creative, to write, to meditate and reflect. These places were churches, parks, even my own backyard growing up in Brazil. In creating this site, I hope to catalogue places I've visited, providing some cool geocolation and wikipedia data about them. I also hope for contributions from you. The world is a vast place, and there is much to explore!
        </p>
        <h3>How do I contact you in case I have suggestions or issues to report?</h3>
        <p class="lead">Please note Places of Power is a project in development. You can email-me at <a href="mailto:magick.code@gmail.com">magick.code@gmail.com</a>. Thank you!

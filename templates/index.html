        <h1>Welcome to Places of Power</h1>
        <p class="lead">Egypt, Stonehenge, Machu Picchu. Places of Power are geolocations across the globe, 
          known for their spiritual, religious and mystical significance. 
          Some are ancient, others are modern. They are centers of energy and inspiration.
          Some are well known, like the Great Pyramids of Egypt,
          yet there are those Places of Power unique to only a few people, perhaps to even just one person.
          This site aims to discover and catalogue all such places by having you, as the user, contribute with your own Places.
          Together we can learn and discover these mysterious locations. This project is dedicated to all 
          those who seek magic in a disenchanted modern world.
